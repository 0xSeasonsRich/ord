`Rune Alpha ord`
=====


`ord` is an index, block explorer, and command-line wallet. It is experimental
software with no warranty. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more details.

Ordinal theory imbues satoshis with numismatic value, allowing them to
be collected and traded as curios.

Rune alpha ord is forked version inherited from the official release of Ord: [Release 0.11.1](https://github.com/0xmodule/ord/commit/19db94a8de00885fd5043ef8c7a5021865843a46)

In this edition we will focus on the Fungible Token architecture being proposed on Bitcoin called Rune

See [the docs](https://docs.ordinals.com) for documentation and guides.
